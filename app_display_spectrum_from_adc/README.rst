Description
-----------

This demonstration uses the U16 core board to create a level-meter kind of spectral display on an LCD for an analog audio input. This application showcases the use of multichannel ADC in an xCORE-USB series XMOS device to sample the analog input, and real-time rendering and display of spectrum by taking short-time fourier transform.
The rendered image is stored in SDRAM.
