Executing The Project
---------------------
The module by itself cannot be built or executed separately - it must be linked in to an application. Once the module is linked to the application, the application can be built and tested for driving a LCD screen.

The following should be done in order to link the component to the application project
  #. The module name ``module_display_controller`` should be added to the list of MODULES in the application project build options. 
  #. The module name ``module_lcd`` should be added to the list of MODULES in the application project build options. 
  #. The module name ``module_sdram`` should be added to the list of MODULES in the application project build options. 
  #. Now the module is linked to the application and can be used directly

Software Requirements
---------------------

The module is built on XDE Tool version 12.0
The module can be used in version 12.0 or any higher version of xTIMEcomposer.
