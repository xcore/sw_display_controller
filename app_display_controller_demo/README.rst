:scope: Example
:description: A full Display Controller application for driving the XA-Sk-480 LCD in conjunction with the SDRAM Controller and LCD Driver components.
:keywords: LCD, Display, Framebuffer, Touch Controller
:boards: XA-SK-SCR480, XA-SK-SDRAM

This application uses the Display Controller Component for Framebuffer Management, and implements a series of transitions between full screen colour still images on top of that, with the transition effect determined by touching a region of the screen. The application can be easily modified for larger screens up to 800x600 pixels.
